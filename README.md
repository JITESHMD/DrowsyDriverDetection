# DrowsyDriverDetection(Intel One API)

Drowsy driver detection refers to the use of technology to identify when a driver is becoming drowsy or falling asleep at the wheel. This technology typically involves monitoring the driver's behavior and physiological signals, such as eye movements, head movements, and changes in heart rate and breathing patterns.


Once the drowsiness detection system detects that the driver is becoming drowsy or falling asleep, it can issue alerts to wake the driver up, such as audible alarms or vibrations in the steering wheel or seat. In some cases, the system may also take more drastic actions, such as slowing down the vehicle or bringing it to a stop.


Drowsy driver detection systems are designed to improve safety on the road by reducing the risk of accidents caused by driver fatigue. They are particularly important for long-distance truck drivers, shift workers, and others who may be at high risk of drowsy driving.
